AltSoftSerial library uses Timer interrupt with compare match (Compare A for transmission and compare B for reception).

Timer0 does not has compare match functionality. Moreover Timer0 is used by functions by Time library which provides functions such as millis().

Arduino Mega (Atmega 2560) has 6 timers. 2 are 8-bit and 4 are 16-bit

Q: Does AltSoftSerial uses 8-bit or 16-bit library? Is 8-bit resolution enough for AltSoftSerial to function properly?

Following is mentioned in examples/Echo/echo.ino
// AltSoftSerial always uses these pins:
//
// Board          Transmit  Receive   PWM Unusable
                  (Input    (Ouput
                  Capture    Compare 
                  Pin)       A Pin)
// -----          --------  -------   ------------
// Teensy 3.0 & 3.1  21        20         22
// Teensy 2.0         9        10       (none)
// Teensy++ 2.0      25         4       26, 27
// Arduino Uno        9         8         10
// Arduino Leonardo   5        13       (none)
// Arduino Mega      
             Timer4  49         6        7, 8
             Timer5  46        48       44, 45

// Wiring-S           5         6          4
// Sanguino          13        14         12

Q: Why transmit and receive pins are fixed? Can they be changed?
A: The above pins are hard-coded in config/AltSoftSerial_Boards.h

 That means they can probably be changed.

 On further investigation, it is found that pins can NOT be changed. The pins are decided
 by the timer. Each timer has 3 pins associate with it - Input Capture Pin, Output Compare A pin and Output Compare B pin.

 Input capture pin is used as Rx and Ouput compare A pin is used as Tx.

 Q: Is there a possibility of interrupt getting missed?
 A: The ISR disables the interrupts for some time. It may be possible that other interrupt might be missed.

 The library needs 3 types of interrupts:
   1. Compare A Interrupt: Occurs when value of timer register TCNT equals OCRnA
   2. Compare B Interrupt: Occurs when value of timer register TCNT equals OCRnB
   3. Capture interrupt: Occur when there is change in level on input capture pin ICP

 First interrupt is used for transmission.

 Other 2 interrupts are used for reception.

 What does cli() function does?

Q: Does this library work with 8-bit timer, or it always needs 16-bit timers?
A: Since Mega 8-bit timers don't have capture mode, they cannot be used for AltSoftSerial library
All 4 16-bit timer have capture mode

In Mega, Timer0 and Timer2 are 8-bit.
and Timer1, 3, 4 are 16-bit.

             ICPn          OCnA      OCnB    OCnC
Timer 1    47 (PD4)      24 (PB6)11  25 (PB7)12   26 (PB7)13   
Timer 3     9 (PE7)       5 (PE3)5   6 (PE4)2     7 (PE5)3
Timer 4    35 (PL0)49      15 (PH3)6  16 (PH4)7   17 (PH5)8
